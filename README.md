# LANL-EarthQuake-Prediction
Forecasting earthquakes is one of the most important problems in Earth science because of their devastating consequences. Current scientific studies related to earthquake forecasting focus on three key points: when the event will occur, where it will occur, and how large it will be.

In this competition, you will address when the earthquake will take place. Specifically, youâ€™ll predict the time remaining before laboratory earthquakes occur from real-time seismic data.

# Data Description
he goal of this competition is to use seismic signals to predict the timing of laboratory earthquakes. The data comes from a well-known experimental set-up used to study earthquake physics. The acoustic_data input signal is used to predict the time remaining before the next laboratory earthquake (time_to_failure).

The training data is a single, continuous segment of experimental data. The test data consists of a folder containing many small segments. The data within each test file is continuous, but the test files do not represent a continuous segment of the experiment; thus, the predictions cannot be assumed to follow the same regular pattern seen in the training file.

For each seg_id in the test folder, you should predict a single time_to_failure corresponding to the time between the last row of the segment and the next laboratory earthquake.
